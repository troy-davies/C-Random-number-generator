Plans for 1.0:
- Remake the entire thing to achieve full randomisation (using libsodium-dev) -DONE
- Add support for invoking via a single command. Example: crand -min 1 -max 100 -TO DO
- Compile for Linux powered systems -DONE
- Adjust line count in README -NOT NEEDED
Plans for later:
- Add an optional GUI
- Add a windows installer for the GUI version
- If flexible enough; Like support for pipes, publish to debian repos
- Add advanced pipe or input/output controls such as inputting a list of minimum/maximum numbers from a list or outputting a list
- Possibly instead of specifically mentioning minimum and maximum numbers, minimum and maximum numbers may be inferred from which number is greater
# While simplicity may indicate little knowlage of external libraries, It is also greater than the power to bloat up the application.
