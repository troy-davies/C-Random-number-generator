Plans for 1.0:
- Remake the entire thing to achieve full randomisation
- Add support for invoking via a single command. Example: crand -min 1 -max 100
- Compile for Linux powered systems
- Adjust line count in README
Plans for later:
- Add an optional GUI
- Add a windows installer for the GUI version
- If flexible enough; Like support for pipes, publish to debian repos
# While simplicity may indicate little knowlage of external libraries, It is also greater than the power to bloat up the application.
