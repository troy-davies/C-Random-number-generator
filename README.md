# C-Random-number-generator
A very simple random number generator written in C, very much usable but also for learning c or use in situations where randomisation is a critical feature that must be speedy.
Written in twenty lines of code.
Weather you are an online service provider or want to flip a nonexistent coin, this program can be for you.
At the moment, releases do not require installation. Just run the executable through the command line.
Command line only...
For now.
